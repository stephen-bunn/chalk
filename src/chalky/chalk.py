@dataclass
class Chalk:
    """Describes the style and color to use for styling some printable text.

    Chalk can be composed using ``&`` and can be applied to strings with ``|``.
    You can create your own instance of chalk by setting your desired
    :class:`~style.Style` and :class:`~color.Color` when creating a new instance.

    Examples:
        Creating custom instances of chalk looks like the following:

        >>> my_chalk = Chalk(
        ...     style={Style.BOLD, Style.UNDERLINE},
        ...     foreground=Color.RED,
        ... )

        Composing two chalk instances can be done through either using ``&`` or ``+``:

        >>> bold_chalk = Chalk(style={Style.BOLD})
        >>> error_chalk = bold_chalk & Chalk(foreground=Color.RED)

        Using chalk instances to style strings can be done using either ``|`` or ``+``:

        >>> error_chalk | "Hello, World!"
        Hello, World!


    .. important::

        When composing two chalk instances together, the chalk *being* applied to the
        base chalk instance will override the foreground and background colors.
        This means that if you apply a new chalk with a different foreground color it
        will override the starting foreground color:

        Examples:
            >>> red = Chalk(foreground=Color.RED)
            >>> blue = Chalk(foreground=Color.BLUE)
            >>> assert blue == (red & blue)
