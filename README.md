> Simple ANSI terminal text coloring

Yet another terminal text coloring libraryâ€¦

Why? Because, I like certain things and I hate certain things about the currently
available solutions.
This here is my attempt to build an interface for simply applying ANSI escape sequences
to strings that I enjoy and can update at my own free will.
That is it, there is nothing new or interesting that this packages adds.
Thanks ðŸŽ‰
